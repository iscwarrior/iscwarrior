👋 Hi, I'm Daniel
👀 I am interested in topics related to information technology, such as; databases, programming, networks, opensource servers, data science, data mining. In the same way I feel great attraction for algorithms, heuristics and statistics.
🌱 I'm currently learning how to use Python and Oracle..
💞️ I would like to support Data Science or data mining projects, since I consider that it is where I have the most passion.
